# Kiryu-game

## If generic mass-produced 2D girls get their own games then kiryu gets his own game

i was experimenting with gsap and motion one when i got the idea to make a fun project using them so the code is far from perfect or optimized but im planning on cleaning it up later but for now enjoy the kiryu yoshi-yosh!

also currently using random gifs for the lack of a better alternative, and i cant draw :D
